# Deep Learning Based Upper Respiratory Infections Detection  

This project applies deep learning techniques to medical imaging data for the detection and classification of upper respiratory tract infections.  
The goal is to support early diagnosis and improve clinical decision-making through automated image analysis.  

The system is implemented as a **Flutter mobile application** integrated with a deep learning model, providing an accessible tool for real-time predictions.


## Getting Started  

Clone the repository, navigate into the project folder, install dependencies, and run the application:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/upper-respiratory-infections-detection.git && \
